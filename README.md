# Welcome to the Luminous Green Elephant Project!
Inside this repo is my submission for a technical assessment. I was tasked with creating a module to match a provided wireframe and endpoint of data. My approach for setting up something easy and reliable was to use React and build a specific component for this module that is reusable and flexible. I wanted to make sure that the component could accept the same structure of data and spit out the same type of component without much hassle. The component supports a muted, looping video player that will autoplay on page load. It also has a default caption track for accessibility purposes that indicates to deaf & hard of hearing users that this video is intentionally muted and has no audio.

To preview my work, you can clone this repo onto your computer and follow the directions below provided by create-react-app. Here's also a quick command line process:

1. git clone REPO_LINK
2. cd luminous-green-elephant
3. npm start

If you are looking to host this app online, use the command 'npm run build' when connecting it to your hosting service of choice.


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
